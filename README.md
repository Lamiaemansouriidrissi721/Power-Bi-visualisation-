This project focuses on a business intelligence use case, where Power BI was used to create insightful data visualizations for a targeted marketing campaign. The objective was to identify key customer segments and enhance both online and offline sales efforts through data-driven decisions.
Problem Statement

"How can we create a targeted marketing campaign to maximize the effectiveness of our online and offline sales efforts, based on the average number of products purchased and age groups of our customers?"
Methodology

The analysis was performed using Power BI to:

    Segment customers by age intervals, income, and education levels.
    Compare online and offline sales performance.
    Identify the most purchased products across different customer segments.
    Provide actionable insights to design effective marketing strategies.
